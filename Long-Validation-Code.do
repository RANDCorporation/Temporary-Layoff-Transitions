/***************************************************************************************************************
This validation do file will validate links based on AGE, SEX, and RACE for any linked long file where the
following assumptions are met:
1. All nonlinks based on CPSIDP are dropped before validation
2. Only matches across all observations of AGE, SEX, and RACE are considered valid

The user must specify the number of expected observations as an argument to the do file (do validate_long.txt 2). 
If a user wishes to add other validation variables to the basic AGE, SEX, and RACE, these may be added
as an argument as well (i.e. do validate_wide_test.txt 2 marst  - this will validate a linked file with two time 
observations on AGE, SEX, RACE, and MARST).

If you want to use this validation code, no changes are required. Simply refer to this do file from within another
do file. For example, if you want to validate links across two time points:
	do validate_long.txt 2
